e-commerce website for wrist watches.First personal big project with main focus on HTML and CSS(SCSS) with some Javascript.It has fully functional user authorization and authentication along with a very simple cart(Node JS + MongoDB on the backend).Doing it with JWT in localstorage.Biggest challenge by far was creating userAuth and connecting it with cart,but it was alot of fun for me.This is the static part of the site - had to separate from api so i can host it on github pages.
